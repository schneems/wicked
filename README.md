# Step-By-Step Wizard Controllers

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/schneems/wicked.png)](http://travis-ci.org/schneems/wicked) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/schneems/wicked)

Use wicked to make your Rails controllers into step-by-step wizards. To see Wicked in action check out the example [Rails app](https://github.com/schneems/wicked_example) or [watch the screencast](http://schneems.com/post/18437886598/wizard-ify-your-rails-controllers-with-wicked).

## Why

Many times I'm left wanting a RESTful way to display a step by step process that may or not be associated with a resource. Wicked gives the flexibility to do what I want while hiding all the really nasty stuff you shouldn't do in a controller to make this possible. At it's core Wicked is a RESTful(ish) state machine, but you don't need to know that, just use it.

## Install

Add this to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'wicked'
```

Then run `bundle install` and you're ready to start

## How

We are going to build an 'after signup' wizard. If you don't have a `current_user` then check out how to [Build a step-by-step object with Wicked](https://github.com/schneems/wicked/wiki/Building-Partial-Objects-Step-by-Step).

First create a controller:

```
rails g controller after_signup
```

Add Routes into `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
resources :after_signup
```

Next include `Wicked::Wizard` in your controller

```ruby

class AfterSignupController < ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends
  # ...

```

You can also use the old way of inheriting from `Wicked::WizardController`.

```ruby

class AfterSignupController < Wicked::WizardController

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends
  # ...

```

The wizard is set to call steps in order in the show action, you can specify custom logic in your show using a case statement like below. To send someone to the first step in this wizard we can direct them to `after_signup_path(:confirm_password)`.

```ruby
class AfterSignupController < ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

  def show
    @user = current_user
    case step
    when :find_friends
      @friends = @user.find_friends
    end
    render_wizard
  end
end
```

**Note:** Wicked uses the `:id` parameter to control the flow of steps, if you need to have an id parameter, please use nested routes see [building objects with wicked](https://github.com/schneems/wicked/wiki/Partial-Validation-of-Active-Record-Objects) for an example. It will need to be prefixed, for example a Product's `:id` would be `:product_id`

You'll need to call `render_wizard` at the end of your action to get the correct views to show up.

By default the wizard will render a view with the same name as the step. So for our controller `AfterSignupController` with a view path of `/views/after_signup/` if call the :confirm_password step, our wizard will render `/views/after_signup/confirm_password.html.erb`

Then in your view you can use the helpers to get to the next step.

```erb
<%= link_to 'skip', next_wizard_path %>
```

You can manually specify which wizard action you want to link to by using the wizard_path helper.

```erb
<%= link_to 'skip', wizard_path(:find_friends) %>
```

In addition to showing sequential views we can update elements in our controller.


```ruby
class AfterSignupController < ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

  def update
    @user = current_user
    case step
    when :confirm_password
      @user.update_attributes(params[:user])
    end
    sign_in(@user, :bypass => true) # needed for devise
    render_wizard @user
  end
end
```

We're passing `render_wizard` our `@user` object here. If you pass an object into `render_wizard` it will show the next step if the object saves or re-render the previous view if it does not save.


To get to this update action, you simply need to submit a form that PUT's to the same url

```erb
<%= form_for @user, :url => wizard_path, :method => :put do |f| %>
  <%=  f.password_field :password  %>
  <%=  f.password_field :password_confirmation  %>

  <%= f.submit "Change Password" %>
<% end %>
```

We explicitly tell the form to PUT above. If you forget this, you will get a warning about the create action not existing, or no route found for POST. Don't forget this.


In the controller if you find that you want to skip a step, you can do it simply by calling `skip_step`

```ruby
def show
  @user = current_user
  case step
  when :find_friends
    if @user.has_facebook_access_token?
      @friends = @user.find_friends
    else
      skip_step
    end
  end
  render_wizard
end
```

Now you've got a fully functioning AfterSignup controller! If you have questions or if you struggled with something, let me know on [twitter](http://twitter.com/schneems), and i'll try to make it better or make the docs better.

## Quick Reference

View/URL Helpers

```ruby
wizard_path                  # Grabs the current path in the wizard
wizard_path(:specific_step)  # Url of the :specific_step
next_wizard_path             # Url of the next step
previous_wizard_path         # Url of the previous step

# These only work while in a Wizard, and are not absolute paths
# You can have multiple wizards in a project with multiple `wizard_path` calls
```


Controller Tidbits:

```ruby
steps  :first, :second       # Sets the order of steps
step                         # Gets symbol of current step
next_step                    # Gets symbol of next step
skip_step                    # Tells render_wizard to skip to the next logical step
render_wizard                # Renders the current step
render_wizard(@user)         # Shows next_step if @user.save, otherwise renders current step
```


Finally:

Don't forget to create your named views

```
app/
  views/
    controller_name/
      first.html.erb
      second.html.erb
      # ...
```


# Finish Wizard Path

You can specify the url that your user goes to by over-riding the `finish_wizard_path` in your wizard controller.


```ruby
def finish_wizard_path
  user_path(current_user)
end
```


### Testing with RSpec

```ruby
# Test find_friends block of show action
get :show, :id => :find_friends

# Test find_friends block of update action
put :update, {'id' => 'find_friends', "user" => { "id" => @user.id.to_s }}
```


### Internationalization of URLS (I18n)

If your site works in multiple languages, or if you just want more control over how your URL's look you can now use I18n with wicked. To do so you need to replace this:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard
```

With this:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard::Translated
```

This will allow you to specify translation keys instead of literal step names. Let's say you've got steps that look like this:

    steps :first, :second

So the urls would be `/after_signup/first` and `/after_signup/second`. But you want them to show up differently for different locales. For example someone coming form a Spanish speaking locale should see `/after_signup/uno` and `after_signup/dos`.

To internationalize first you need to create your locales files under `config/locales` such as `config/locales/es.yml` for Spanish. You then need to add a `first` and `second` key under a `wicked` key like this:

```yaml
es:
  hello: "hola mundo"
  wicked:
    first: "uno"
    second: "dos"
```

It would also be a good idea to create a english version under `config/locales/en.yml` or your english speaking friends will get errors. If your app already uses I18n you don't need to do anything else, if not you will need to make sure that you set the `I18n.locale` on each request you could do this somewhere like a before filter in your application_controller.rb

```ruby
before_filter :set_locale

private

def set_locale
  I18n.locale = params[:locale] if params[:locale].present?
end

def default_url_options(options = {})
  {locale: I18n.locale}
end
```

For a screencast on setting up and using I18n check out [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/episodes/138-i18n-revised). You can also read the [free I18n Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html).

Now when you visit your controller with the proper locale set your url's should be more readable like `/after_signup/uno` and `after_signup/dos`.

Wicked expects your files to be named the same as your keys, so when a user visits `after_signup/dos` with the `es` locale it will render the `second.html.erb` file.

## Custom URL's

Very similar to using I18n from above but instead of making new files for different languages, you can stick with one language. Make sure you are using the right module:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard::Translated
```

Then you'll need to specify translations in your language file. For me, the language I'm using is english so I can add translations to `config/locales/en.yml`

```yaml
en:
  hello: "hello world"
  wicked:
    first: "verify_email"
    second: "if_you_are_popular_add_friends"
```

Now you can change the values in the URL's to whatever you want without changing your controller or your files, just modify your `en.yml`. If you're not using English you can set your default_locale to something other than `en` in your `config/application.rb` file.

```ruby
config.i18n.default_locale = :de
```

Custom crafted wizard urls: just another way Wicked makes your app a little more saintly.

## Dynamic Step Names

If you wish to set the order of your steps dynamically you can do this with a `prepend_before_filter` and `self.steps =` like this:

```ruby
include Wicked::Wizard
prepend_before_filter :set_steps

# ...

private
def set_steps
  if params[:flow] == "twitter"
    self.steps = [:ask_twitter, :ask_email]
  elsif params[:flow] == "facebook"
    self.steps = [:ask_facebook, :ask_email]
  end
end
```
